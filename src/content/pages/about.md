# The making of a wordsmith

I am a biology graduate who was involved in research for some years, but then decided to pursue my love of writing.

This began with some creative projects - including a fantasy trilogy that was published in the early 1990s.

During the 1990s, I had 30 short children's stories transmitted on BBC and ITV. I also became a Member of the Society of Authors.

More recently, ten new children’s stories were read by comedian Lenny Henry on CBBC.

With my scientific and artistic backgrounds, I am able to offer a unique blend of creative flair and technical accuracy.



# Words and images

In my spare time, I am a keen amateur photographer, and have won numerous trophies in club competitions.

Some of my images can be seen on these web pages - I hope you enjoy them.

I have also been working closely with Paul Rapson, a professional photographer who has produced some stunning creative images.

Together, we staged a three week exhibition of Paul's photos and my words, entitled: "New Perspectives" at Hanger Farm Arts Centre in Totton.
